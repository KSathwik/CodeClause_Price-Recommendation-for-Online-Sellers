Description- E-commerce platforms today are extensively driven by machine learning algorithms, right from quality checking and inventory management to sales demographics and product recommendations, all use machine learning. One more interesting business use case that e-commerce apps and websites are trying to solve is to eliminate human interference in providing price suggestions to the sellers on their marketplace to speed up the efficiency of the shopping website or app. That's when price recommendation using machine learning comes to play.

Price Recommendation for Online Sellers lets suppliers compare their prices with other vendors, prices for the same or similar products. In terms of sales growth, it displays the impact that accepting price recommendations has had at both the product and the overall level.

They can filter products based on item category and/or sales numbers (“Top Selling”, “Low Selling” or “Non Selling”). To help them make an informed decision, we also display the transfer price, i.e., the amount that they will receive after accounting for logistics.
